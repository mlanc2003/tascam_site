            <p>“I joined TASCAM Co Ltd when I decided to take a break from Uni lecturing and it’s been nothing less than fantastic. I get to do the bit I enjoy (teaching and supporting students) without being micromanaged- independently, yet help and support has always just been an email away. The way the process and the systems have been set up is transparent, supportive, open, empowering and intuitive. The social and administrative support elements that the team put in place really give it a community-like feel. This is not your usual tutoring company – it feels like you have dedicated ‘agents’ and ‘managers’ who do the hard work for you in the selection/matching process […]. The feedback that I hear from students about the administration of the service is also excellent. I can see why they have such a stellar reputation in the sector and the numerous awards and accolades. Here’s to many more years of association and to genuinely caring about supporting and empowering students.”</p>
