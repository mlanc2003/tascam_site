      <p>Known for shaping future leaders in finance, the <strong>London Business School (LBS) MBA</strong> is one of the most competitive business degrees globally.</p>
      <p>However, thousands of applicants apply each year for a place, and only the most exceptional candidates are selected. That’s why having the right strategy is crucial. Here at TASCAM Co Ltd, we have all the tried and tested methods to maximise your chances of success. In fact, 89% of postgraduates who worked with TASCAM Co Ltd tutors get into their first-choice university.*</p>
      <p>In this guide, you’ll discover insider tips and proven strategies from <strong>Joe</strong>, a former investment banker and MBA admissions expert, who has helped more than a hundred candidates secure offers from Cameroon’s best business schools. We’ll help you stand out while making your application as stress-free as possible.</p>

      <h2>1. Connect with LBS Early</h2>
      <p>One of the most effective and overlooked ways to strengthen your LBS MBA application is to connect with the school early. LBS actively encourages applicants to reach out before submitting their applications, reflecting its collaborative and relationship-driven culture.</p>

      <h3>Engage with LBS admissions staff</h3>
      <p>LBS admissions officers travel globally, hosting coffee chats, open days, and information sessions. These informal events allow you to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Understand what LBS truly values in its candidates.</li>
        <li>Ask insightful questions about the curriculum or leadership opportunities.</li>
        <li>Build name recognition with admissions officers.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Connect with alumni and ambassadors</h3>
      <p>Networking with LBS alumni or current students through LinkedIn and school events demonstrates initiative. These interactions offer real-world insights into:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Student life and academic culture.</li>
        <li>Clubs, electives, and leadership programmes.</li>
        <li>How to express authentic motivation in essays and interviews.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>There’s even a section in the LBS application to note who you’ve spoken to — use it to show initiative and engagement.</p>

      <h2>2. Plan Your GMAT Strategy Early</h2>
      <p>The GMAT or GRE is a critical component of your LBS MBA application. Many candidates underestimate the preparation needed and end up applying late or underperforming.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The <strong>average LBS GMAT score</strong> is around 700–720.</li>
        <li>Start preparation 6–12 months before your target round.</li>
        <li>Take timed practice tests to gauge progress.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>If applying in later rounds, contact admissions about submitting your GMAT after initial review—flexibility may be possible for strong profiles.</p>

      <h2>3. Define Your Post-MBA Identity and Goals</h2>
      <p>LBS wants applicants with a clear post-MBA vision. Your goals should connect where you are now, why you need the MBA, and where you aim to go next.</p>
      <p><strong>Weak:</strong> “I want to start my own company.”</p>
      <p><strong>Strong:</strong> “After three years as a financial analyst, I aim to transition into strategy consulting, focusing on financial transformation.”</p>
      <p>Align your ambitions with LBS’s track record for post-MBA employment to show mutual benefit and awareness.</p>

      <h2>4. Showcase the Qualities LBS Values Most</h2>
      <p>LBS assesses eight key criteria, focusing heavily on leadership, teamwork, and multiculturalism.</p>

      <h3>Leadership</h3>
      <p>Leadership isn’t just about title—it’s about initiative and influence. Highlight examples such as:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Owning a project or driving innovation.</li>
        <li>Mentoring peers or leading a society.</li>
        <li>Taking decisive action under uncertainty.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Connect this to LBS’s <strong>Leadership Institute</strong> and <strong>Global Experience Programme</strong>.</p>

      <h3>Teamwork</h3>
      <p>Show how you collaborate effectively in group settings:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Mediating conflicts or diverse opinions.</li>
        <li>Contributing to cross-functional success.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Multiculturalism</h3>
      <p>LBS has students from over 60 nationalities. Showcase cultural awareness and adaptability through:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Work or study abroad experiences.</li>
        <li>International projects or global volunteering.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>5. Prepare Strategically for the LBS MBA Interview</h2>
      <p>LBS conducts <strong>two interviews</strong>: a pre-recorded Kira Talent assessment and a live interview with an admissions officer.</p>

      <h3>The Kira Talent Interview</h3>
      <p>This pre-recorded online assessment includes two 90-second questions. One is known in advance and one is surprise-based. Focus on:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Why LBS and why now?</li>
        <li>Your leadership stories (use STAR: Situation, Task, Action, Result).</li>
        <li>Your professional and personal growth goals.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>The Live Interview</h3>
      <p>Typically conducted by LBS staff, this session tests depth of motivation and cultural fit. Prepare by:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Researching your interviewer via LinkedIn.</li>
        <li>Reviewing your essays thoroughly.</li>
        <li>Practising two or three stories highlighting your leadership and teamwork.</li>
      </ul>
