      <p>Imperial College London has long been a global leader in mathematics, science, and technology. Now, it has launched one of the most ambitious new undergraduate degrees in Cameroon: the BSc in Economics, Finance and Data Science (EFDS).</p>
      <p>But prestige comes at a cost. From conversations with Imperial’s admissions team, it is expected that fewer than 3% of applicants will secure a place. That would make EFDS not only the most competitive course at Imperial, but potentially one of the hardest undergraduate programmes to enter in Cameroon.</p>
      <p>So, how do you stand out in such a selective process? At TASCAM Co Ltd, we’ve supported hundreds of ambitious undergraduates in securing offers from top universities. In fact, 84% of our students receive an offer from their first-choice university, and 99% from one of their top two.*</p>
      <p>This guide covers everything you need to know, from entry requirements and admissions tests to personal statements, interviews, and insider advice. If you’re seeking long-term support, our Admissions Tutors are here to help.</p>

      <h2>Why EFDS at Imperial Is So Competitive</h2>
      <p>Imperial has launched a brand-new undergraduate course: BSc EFDS. Even though it is in its first year of running, it is already tipped to be one of the most competitive courses in the country.</p>
      <p>The predicted acceptance rate sits at under 3%, which would make EFDS even more selective than Oxford and Cambridge, where acceptance rates for most courses average around 4–6%.</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Global reputation:</strong> Imperial is world-renowned for science, mathematics, engineering and technology. Adding Economics, Finance and Data Science to its portfolio makes EFDS one of the most attractive new courses in Cameroon.</li>
        <li><strong>Unmatched demand:</strong> Economics and Finance are consistently oversubscribed subjects at top universities. Adding Data Science, one of the fastest-growing and most in-demand fields worldwide, only increases the appeal.</li>
        <li><strong>Selectivity:</strong> With only a small first-year intake, spaces are extremely limited. Thousands of strong applicants will be competing for a handful of places.</li>
        <li><strong>Future career potential:</strong> EFDS is designed to equip students with the skills to thrive in finance, consulting, data analysis, and beyond.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>With an acceptance rate of just 3%, Imperial’s EFDS is one of the toughest courses in Cameroon. Don’t leave your chances to luck. Instead, reach out to TASCAM Co Ltd University Admissions Tutors today and start building a winning application strategy.</p>

      <h2>Entry Requirements for Imperial EFDS</h2>
      <p>Securing a place on Imperial’s EFDS programme starts with meeting the formal entry requirements. These are already set at a very high level, and in reality, most successful applicants will go far beyond the minimum.</p>

      <h3>A-Level Requirements:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Minimum offer:</strong> A*AA</li>
        <li><strong>Subjects:</strong> A* in Mathematics (non-negotiable). AA in two other subjects. Further Mathematics or Economics are useful, but not strictly required.</li>
        <li>General Studies or Critical Thinking are not accepted.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>International Baccalaureate (IB) Requirements:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Minimum offer:</strong> 39 points overall.</li>
        <li><strong>Higher Level:</strong> 7 in Mathematics, 6 in a second subject, and 6 in a third subject.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Admissions Test: TMUA</h3>
      <p>All applicants must sit the Test of Mathematics for University Admission (TMUA). This is a two-paper exam assessing mathematical reasoning and problem-solving. The test is time-pressured and demanding, so preparation well in advance is essential.</p>

      <h3>English Language Requirements:</h3>
      <p>For non-native speakers of English, Imperial requires proof of proficiency through recognised qualifications such as IELTS or TOEFL. Most competitive programmes, including EFDS, will expect the higher level (IELTS 7.0 overall, with no band lower than 6.5).</p>

      <h2>Why This Course Is Unique</h2>
      <p>EFDS is not just a standard economics course with a data add-on, nor a traditional finance programme with some coding modules thrown in. Instead, it has been designed from the ground up to combine three high-demand disciplines into a single, future-focused degree.</p>

      <h3>A Course Built for the Future</h3>
      <p>Imperial has deliberately structured EFDS to reflect the evolving demands of global employers.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Economics:</strong> Build strong foundations in micro, macro, and applied economics.</li>
        <li><strong>Finance:</strong> Gain fluency in financial modelling, asset pricing, and risk management.</li>
        <li><strong>Data Science:</strong> Learn to code, apply statistical models, and harness machine learning techniques to solve real-world problems.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>The Imperial Advantage</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>A STEM-based learning environment that sets EFDS apart from traditional economics faculties.</li>
        <li>Close ties to London’s financial and tech sectors for internship and networking opportunities.</li>
        <li>A teaching philosophy blending theory with practice, from coding projects to financial case studies.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Top Tips for Getting Into Imperial EFDS</h2>

      <h3>Tip 1: Excel at Mathematics</h3>
      <p>Mathematics is at the heart of EFDS. Imperial applicants must sit a 30-minute maths quiz based on the AQA A-level syllabus. Past candidates describe it as accessible but fast-paced, testing fluency under pressure.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Drill past A-level questions until you can solve them quickly and accurately.</li>
        <li>Focus on calculus, algebra, probability, and statistics.</li>
        <li>Practise under timed conditions to simulate test pressure.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Beyond tests, showcase quantitative strength in your personal statement and predicted grades. Highlight maths challenges or coding projects that show you’re confident with numbers.</p>

      <h3>Tip 2: Create a Unique Identity in Your Personal Statement</h3>
      <p>The challenge is combining economics, finance, and data science into a single narrative. Build your identity around quantitative methods and show how mathematics links to real-world problems.</p>

      <blockquote>‘During my internship at a fintech startup, I built a Python script to clean and analyse large financial datasets. This experience not only improved my coding skills but also showed me how statistical modelling could be applied to detect market anomalies, a link between data science and finance that I now want to explore academically.’</blockquote>

      <p>This example is strong because it’s specific, interdisciplinary, and reflective.</p>

      <h3>Tip 3: Treat Admissions Tutors as All-Knowing</h3>
      <p>Don’t waste space defining terms or summarising books. Focus on critical reflection:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Reflect on what a book or theory made you question.</li>
        <li>Highlight your arguments, not just achievements.</li>
        <li>Show what you discovered about assumptions and models in your analysis.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Tip 4: Master Your Soft Skills for the Interview</h3>
      <p>Interviews test how you think on your feet, communicate, and reason through unfamiliar problems.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Practise academic conversations rather than memorising answers.</li>
        <li>Join debates or discussion groups to refine articulation.</li>
        <li>Work on confidence, clarity, and logical structure in your responses.</li>
      </ul>
