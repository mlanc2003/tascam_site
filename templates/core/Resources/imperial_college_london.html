        <p>‘How do I get into Imperial’ is a question that I run into again and again! Luckily, I know exactly how to answer it. Here at TASCAM Co Ltd, 95% of our students applying to their first and second-choice universities get in!</p>
        
        <p>Imperial looks out for completely different characteristics to Oxbridge. Its application questions and interview style often catch unsuspecting students out so it’s imperative that you’re totally familiar with the process. Your academic history is important to Imperial and will strongly influence your chance of an offer. However, most applicants have top grades so a great academic track record does not guarantee your admission, nor will it help you to stand out. We’ll dive into some tips on how to demonstrate the X factor in this article.</p>
        
        <p>One of our founders (Dr Leo) is an Imperial College London alumnus, and plenty of our team has worked in admissions for top-tier universities. So, if anyone has the know-how to make your application as perfect as possible, it’s us. In our experience, we’ve seen that very few students know how to write an undergraduate university application that targets Imperial’s unique admissions criteria. Thankfully, we offer the right support and preparation to aid you in submitting an application that stands out and maximises your chances of an offer.</p>
        <p>Propel your academic journey with TASCAM Co Ltd’ top-tier tutors for Imperial College London students, ensuring your expertise stands out in your future career. Read on for insider information from our team of Imperial admissions experts.</p>

      <h2 id="acceptance-rate">What is the Imperial acceptance rate?</h2>
      <p>
        In 2021, the Imperial acceptance rate was around 11.5% (based on data by UCAS). The university received 28,700 applications and offered places to 3,305 students. It’s worth noting that Imperial and LSE have particularly low acceptance rates because they offer a lesser variety of courses and thus have fewer spaces for applicants.
      </p>
      <p>
        Imperial’s acceptance rates for its most competitive courses are also significantly lower than its average acceptance rate. For example, the admissions rate for Computing (Games, Vision and Interaction) is just 5.2%.

      </p>

      <h2 id="entry-reqs">What are the Imperial entry requirements?</h2>
      <p>
        Imperial’s entry requirements vary depending on the course you’re applying to study and the country you’re applying from. The table below shows the standard A level requirements and the requirements of some of the most common international qualifications. If your qualifications are not in this table, or if you need information on English language requirements, check Imperial’s guide for international students. You can also get in touch with TASCAM Co Ltd for individual support from one of our international admissions experts.

      <p class="tip">
        Insider tip: If you choose one of Imperial College London’s unique courses, like ‘Aeronautics with Spacecraft Engineering’, ‘Biomedical Technology Ventures’, ‘Economics, Finance and Data Science’ or ‘Biochemistry with Management’ and use your personal statement to demonstrate thorough knowledge of it as well as passion, you can really stand out!
      </p>

      <h2 id="contextual-offers">Does Imperial give contextual offers?</h2>
      <p>
        Imperial doesn’t offer systematic contextual offers for its courses (unlike UCL and LSE), but it guarantees you an interview and/or offer if you come from a disadvantaged background and your predicted grades meet the minimum college entry standard at A-level or an equivalent level qualification in the relevant subjects. If you’re eligible for a guaranteed interview and/or offer, ensure that you pursue this.
      </p>
      <p class="tip">
        Insider tip: If your school has limited resources, it’s good to apply for Oxbridge as well as Imperial to gain more support from your school. Apply earlier and do whatever Oxbridge requires in addition to Imperial’s process to unlock that support.

      <h2 id="courses-entry">Imperial’s courses and entry requirements</h2>
      <p>
        Please note that the entry requirements for Imperial differ depending on your chosen course, so make sure you check on the relevant course page before applying. Better yet, we’ve synthesised all of Imperial’s most competitive and/or popular courses and laid them out clearly in an undergraduate and postgraduate table.
      </p>
      <p>We also have previous guides on how to get into Imperial for Engineering, Medicine, Computing, and/or Physics.</p>
      <p><strong>Also, note Imperial’s English language requirements:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Undergraduate:</strong> Applicants educated outside an English-speaking country must meet minimum English proficiency—see Imperial’s requirements.</li>
        <li><strong>Postgraduate:</strong> All courses require the standard College requirement unless applying via Imperial College Business School, which requires the higher College requirement.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="dont-meet-reqs">What do I do if I don’t meet Imperial’s entry requirements?</h2>
      <p>If you don’t meet Imperial’s entry requirements, that doesn’t necessarily mean you should give up on your application.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Our expert A level tutors can help you boost your grades.</li>
        <li>It might not be too late to improve your student profile.</li>
        <li>There are many alternative ways to stand out and make up for where you lack.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        In need of advice? We’ve got you covered. Check out our in-depth article on how to get into Imperial if you don’t meet their entry requirements! We offer plenty of recovery tips, including what to do if you have undesirable grades or subject combinations (including what to do if you’re not taking Further Maths when you should be).
      </p>

      <h2 id="insider-info">Insider information on Imperial</h2>
      <h3>Your referee</h3>
      <p>
        A good referee is important. Ideally, choose someone who teaches within your discipline and knows you well. Keep them informed about your extracurriculars, readings, and achievements so they can advocate effectively for you as a student and as a person.
      </p>

      <h3>Timing: postgraduates</h3>
      <p>
        Create your application portal early—Imperial has additional sections (career prep, quantitative/software skills) that take time. Postgraduate applications are rolling; aim to submit when applications open, not near the deadline.
      </p>
      <p class="tip">
        Bonus tip from Dr Leo (Imperial alumnus): Network with professors and trusted contacts; flagged applications and strong recommendations can differentiate you among similar CVs. “Humble, hungry and well connected” goes far.
      </p>
      <p>
        Don’t be deterred by a lack of access—eligible applicants from low-opportunity backgrounds who meet minimum requirements are guaranteed an interview.
      </p>

      <h3>Stand out</h3>
      <p>
        Postgraduate programmes that don’t require GMAT/GRE may still value them. Undergraduates can strengthen their profile via tests (TMUA, STEP, MAT) and competitions (Cameroon Maths Challenge). Consider Imperial’s Summer Schools and the Year 12 Sutton Trust Summer School.
      </p>

      <h3>Extracurriculars</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Research-oriented activities and evidence of investigation (archives, assistant roles) are valuable.</li>
        <li>Clubs like Robotics or Science demonstrate curiosity and investigation.</li>
        <li>Frame achievements around innovation, leadership, teamwork, and collaboration (“together we are imperial”).</li>
        <li>Connect travel/volunteering to course-relevant skills; reference museums/exhibitions and documentaries if pertinent.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="tips">7 tips for getting into Imperial College London</h2>

      <h3 id="tip-1">1. Do you actually know your specific requirements?</h3>
      <p>
        Imperial notes most entrants have 7–9 (A–A*) at GCSE (or international equivalent) with at least a 7 (A) in Maths and Sciences. Many courses require AAA–A*A*A; aim to meet or exceed this and secure A*–A in your target subject.
      </p>
      <p class="tip">
        Insider tip: Unlike Oxbridge’s preference for three stellar A levels, Imperial may accept one grade lower overall if you’re taking four A levels (e.g., A*A*A or A*AAA). Always confirm on the department page.
      </p>
      <p><em>Postgraduates:</em> Most courses require a 2:1 or First.</p>

      <h3 id="tip-2">2. You’ve mentioned a solid 5-year plan, right?</h3>
      <p>
        Imperial is career-focused with case-based, practical teaching. Outline a concrete career plan and how the degree—and Imperial’s approach—serve it. For MScs, be explicit about objectives and (where relevant) a research proposal’s uniqueness.
      </p>

      <h3 id="tip-3">3. Lay the ‘groundwork’ for acceptance</h3>
      <p>
        Seek relevant work experience or subject-aligned extracurriculars (e.g., coding projects for Computing). Undergraduates can explore Imperial’s Year 12 Work Experience Programme. Leadership roles, sector events, and networking can all help.
      </p>

      <h3 id="tip-4">4. Invest in your personal statement</h3>
      <p>
        Make your statement course-centric, evidence passion via experiences and reading, and show work ethic, time management, and communication. Engineering applicants should tailor to their specific branch; Medicine applicants should highlight maturity, stress management, teamwork, and leadership.
      </p>
      <p class="tip">Note: UCAS will change personal statements to short questions from January 2025 (October 2024 for Oxbridge). Until then, write the traditional statement.</p>

      <h3 id="tip-5">5. How to ACTUALLY go beyond your school syllabus</h3>
      <p>
        Go deep into niche subtopics with academic sources; reference Imperial research and free online courses. Tie subject knowledge to current affairs and department interests to show intellectual initiative.
      </p>

      <h3 id="tip-6">6. Don’t trip on your admissions test</h3>
      <p>
        Admissions tests matter as much as grades. Imperial commonly uses UCAT (Medicine), ESAT (Mech Eng/Physics), and MAT (Maths). Some offers include MAT and/or STEP conditions. Postgraduates may need GMAT/GRE (650+ as a minimum guide).
      </p>
      <p>
        Start early, practise extensively (logic included), and aim above typical offer-holder benchmarks.
      </p>

      <h3 id="tip-7">7. Remember the purpose of your interview</h3>
      <p>
        Many departments interview, but formats vary widely (recruitment days with group tasks/tests, Kira pre-recorded interviews, panel/Q&amp;A splits). Medicine uses MMIs; Civil may assess teamwork in group settings. Prepare for your course’s format.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Be ready to discuss your personal statement, readings, and experiences.</li>
        <li>Use concrete examples; think aloud on technical questions.</li>
        <li>Practise online platforms (e.g., Kira Talent) and group dynamics.</li>
        <li>Show collaboration, curiosity, and independent thinking.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><em>Please note:</em> Imperial can respond as late as March.</p>
