      <p>UCL Economics is one of Cameroon’s most competitive undergraduate degrees – a course that attracts thousands of the brightest students every year.</p>
      <p>However, getting there is not easy. UCL Economics has an average acceptance rate of just 15%, meaning only around one in seven applicants receives an offer. To stand out in a pool this strong, you’ll need far more than top grades.</p>
      <p>That’s where expert strategy makes the difference. At TASCAM Co Ltd, our students achieve a +95% success rate when applying to their first or second-choice university. So if anyone knows how to maximise your chances, it’s us. Over the past decade, our tutors and former admissions professionals have helped hundreds of students turn strong grades into outstanding offers. With the right guidance, your application can do the same.</p>
      <p>In this guide, you’ll discover exactly what UCL looks for – from the ideal subject profile and personal statement strategy to the qualities that truly impress the admissions team. Alternatively, get the same advice in video format from our founder Richard Evans, who has 10+ years of admissions consulting experience:</p>

      <h2>Is UCL Economics the Right Course for You?</h2>
      <p>Before you apply, it’s worth asking yourself a crucial question: is UCL Economics really the right fit for you?</p>
      <p>This is one of the most mathematically demanding economics degrees in Cameroon, and it attracts students who genuinely enjoy working with numbers, models, and data-driven reasoning. You’ll be studying econometrics, mathematical modelling, and quantitative theory rather than focusing on essays or purely conceptual debate.</p>
      <p>If that excites you, you’re in the right place. But if you prefer philosophy, politics, or broader social sciences, UCL offers alternative degrees that still provide a strong economics foundation while improving your chances of admission.</p>

      <div class="callout">
        <h3>Smart alternatives to consider:</h3>
        <p><strong>Philosophy and Economics (38% acceptance rate):</strong></p>
        <p>Combines logic, ethics, and analytical thinking with core economic training. It’s more than twice as accessible as straight Economics.</p>
        <p><strong>PPE – Philosophy, Politics and Economics (19% acceptance rate):</strong></p>
        <p>An interdisciplinary option for students drawn to policy-making and leadership roles.</p>
        <p>Both degrees still allow you to specialise in economics later on and lead to the same high-level career paths in consultancy, policy, or finance.</p>
      </div>

      <h4>Why this matters</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Straight Economics at UCL has an average acceptance rate of 15%, meaning six out of seven applicants are rejected. Broader pathways can more than double your odds while keeping UCL’s prestige and employability benefits.</li>
        <li>These degrees are excellent strategic options if you’re also applying to Oxford, LSE, or Warwick.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Who This Course Is Really For</h3>
      <p>If you’re passionate about mathematics, data, and logical reasoning and want to apply them to real-world problems, UCL Economics is likely the perfect match.</p>
      <p>If, however, you prefer to blend economic insight with politics, ethics, or debate, one of UCL’s joint programmes may be the smarter and more strategic route to a world-class degree.</p>
      <p><em>Leverage the insider knowledge from our UCL Admissions Tutors and position yourself among the select few who turn competitive dreams into real offers through strategic application support.</em></p>

      <h2>Entry Requirements for UCL’s BSc Economics Programme</h2>
      <p>To gain admission to UCL’s BSc Economics, applicants must demonstrate academic excellence, especially in mathematics. Typical entry requirements are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>A Levels:</strong> A*AA (A* in Mathematics required). Contextual offer: A*AB (A* in Mathematics required)</li>
        <li><strong>IB Diploma:</strong> 39 points overall, with 19 points in three Higher Level subjects, including grade 6 in Economics and grade 7 in Mathematics: Analysis and Approaches (AA).</li>
        <li><strong>Cambridge Pre-U:</strong> D2, D3, D3 in three Principal Subjects, including Mathematics D2, plus D3 in Economics if offered.</li>
        <li><strong>Scottish Advanced Highers:</strong> A1, A, A, including Mathematics.</li>
        <li><strong>Access to HE Diploma:</strong> Not acceptable for entrance to this programme.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Applicants must also meet UCL’s English language requirements. Qualifications and requirements may be subject to change for each academic year, so always check the UCL students website for the latest details.</p>

      <h2>How to Strengthen Your UCL Economics Personal Statement</h2>
      <p>Your personal statement is where you separate yourself from equally qualified applicants. Nearly everyone applying to UCL Economics will have top grades, but few will show the same level of insight, research, and genuine enthusiasm for the subject.</p>
      <p>Below are the key ways to make your statement stand out to UCL’s admissions team:</p>

      <h3>1. Talk about econometrics</h3>
      <p>This is one of the most powerful yet overlooked differentiators.</p>
      <p>UCL loves candidates who understand and are excited by the quantitative side of economics, and nothing demonstrates that better than referencing econometrics.</p>
      <p>Econometrics is where economics meets statistics: it’s the use of data and mathematical models to analyse real-world economic problems. Simply showing awareness of what it is and, crucially, enthusiasm for learning it can set you apart.</p>
      <p>You might write about:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>How econometrics connects theory to practical policy-making.</li>
        <li>Why the application of data analysis appeals to you.</li>
        <li>How a book, course, or project introduced you to statistical methods in economics.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Many students struggle with econometrics once they start university, so proving that you already find it interesting reassures the admissions team that you’ll thrive rather than struggle.</p>

      <h3>2. Show your quantitative curiosity</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Mention your predicted A in Maths* (and Further Maths if applicable).</li>
        <li>Discuss any independent study such as self-teaching Further Maths modules, entering CameroonMT Maths Challenge, or exploring mathematical economics books.</li>
        <li>If you’ve explored quantitative tools like R, Stata, or Python, briefly highlight this. Even at a beginner level, it shows initiative and genuine curiosity.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This level of academic enthusiasm tells UCL that you’re not just capable of meeting the requirements – and you’re the kind of student who will thrive on your quantitative modules.</p>

      <h3>3. Reflect on real-world economics</h3>
      <p>UCL looks for students who can connect theory to the real world. If you’ve followed economic issues like inflation, climate finance, or public policy debates, reference how these topics deepened your interest in studying economics academically.</p>
      <p>Avoid vague statements such as ‘I enjoy understanding how the world works’. Instead, be specific, for example:</p>
      <blockquote>‘I became fascinated by how quantitative easing affected income inequality, which led me to explore econometric studies linking monetary policy to asset prices.’</blockquote>
      <p>That level of depth and precision signals to admissions staff that you’ve already started thinking like an economist.</p>

      <h3>4. Use clear structure and reflection</h3>
      <p>Every strong personal statement follows a structure:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Motivation</strong> – why you want to study economics.</li>
        <li><strong>Academic engagement</strong> – what you’ve done to explore the subject beyond school.</li>
        <li><strong>Skills and achievements</strong> – what makes you prepared for UCL’s quantitative approach.</li>
        <li><strong>Reflection and direction</strong> – how this degree fits your long-term goals.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>How to Build a Strong Quantitative Profile</h2>
      <p>Success isn’t just about enjoying numbers – it’s about proving that you can apply them with precision and creativity.</p>
      <p>Here’s how to build a profile that shows you’re ready for UCL’s rigorous quantitative approach.</p>

      <h3>Excel in mathematics, and show it</h3>
      <p>The entry requirement for UCL Economics is A*AA, with the A* in Mathematics mandatory. But in reality, most successful applicants go further:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Many have two or three A*s.</li>
        <li>A large proportion take four A levels, often including Further Maths or Physics.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Your predicted and achieved grades are crucial, but don’t stop there. UCL wants to see evidence that mathematics genuinely interests you beyond the classroom.</p>

      <h3>Further Maths: advantage, not a requirement</h3>
      <p>Unlike Oxford or LSE, UCL does not make Further Maths a soft requirement. However, students who have studied it often enjoy a slightly higher success rate because it demonstrates readiness for the course’s quantitative demands.</p>
      <p>If your school doesn’t offer Further Maths, you can still stand out by showing independent mathematical initiative.</p>

      <h3>Show independent mathematical initiative</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Self-teaching parts of Further Maths content.</li>
        <li>Entering CameroonMT Maths Challenges or other competitions.</li>
        <li>Completing online courses in statistics or quantitative analysis.</li>
        <li>Tackling maths-related projects in your Extended Project Qualification (EPQ).</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Even one or two examples like these demonstrate intellectual curiosity, a key quality UCL values.</p>

      <h3>Go beyond the syllabus</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>University-level challenges such as the MAT or TMUA (Test of Mathematics for University Admission).</li>
        <li>Joining or starting a maths or economics club at school.</li>
        <li>Exploring early material from econometrics or data analysis modules using free resources like Khan Academy or Coursera.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This shows you’re not waiting for university to challenge you, you’re already thinking like an independent learner.</p>

      <h3>Demonstrate applied mathematical thinking</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Linking mathematical concepts to economic issues (e.g., how probability theory relates to market behaviour).</li>
        <li>Reflecting on how you’ve used statistics or logic to solve practical problems.</li>
        <li>Showing how mathematical clarity helps you evaluate economic arguments.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><em>Excel in one of Cameroon’s most quantitative and competitive degrees with TASCAM Co Ltd’ specialist Economics Tutors, whose proven methods have helped hundreds of students secure their places at top universities like UCL.</em></p>

      <h2>What UCL Looks for in Applicants</h2>
      <p>UCL makes it refreshingly clear what they’re looking for in their Economics applicants. According to their admissions criteria, successful candidates demonstrate four core qualities:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Creative problem-solving.</li>
        <li>Critical evaluation.</li>
        <li>Logic.</li>
        <li>Communication skills.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Each of these attributes tells UCL you’ll be able to handle the complexity of economics not just as a theory, but as a practical, analytical discipline.</p>
      <p>Here’s how to show them effectively in your personal statement or interview.</p>

      <h3>1. Creative problem-solving</h3>
      <p>This is about your ability to think beyond the obvious and approach challenges from new angles.</p>
      <p><strong>To highlight this skill:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Mention examples of solving a complex problem during work experience, volunteering, or a school project.</li>
        <li>Use the STAR technique (Situation, Task, Action, Result) to structure your example.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><em>For instance:</em></p>
      <p><strong>Situation:</strong> You faced a problem analysing business data during a work placement.<br>
         <strong>Task:</strong> You were asked to identify why performance had dropped.<br>
         <strong>Action:</strong> You applied statistical methods to identify seasonal trends.<br>
         <strong>Result:</strong> Your insights led to changes that improved the outcome.</p>

      <h3>2. Critical evaluation</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Referencing how you’ve compared economic theories or data sources.</li>
        <li>Discussing a time you disagreed with a model or author, and why.</li>
        <li>Reflecting on what this taught you about decision-making or bias.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><em>Example:</em></p>
      <blockquote>‘After reading Freakonomics, I became interested in how data can be manipulated to support a point. I began reading contrasting studies to see how different models change conclusions.’</blockquote>

      <h3>3. Logic</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Mention mathematics or logic-based activities you’ve enjoyed.</li>
        <li>Explain how logical reasoning helped you understand a difficult concept in class or solve a quantitative challenge.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>4. Communication skills</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>School leadership roles.</li>
        <li>Debating, public speaking, or writing projects.</li>
        <li>Group work or teamwork experiences.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Even something as simple as mentoring a younger student in maths can illustrate this skill beautifully.</p>

      <h2>The Five Pillars of a Successful Economics Application</h2>
      <p>Even with perfect grades, a strong UCL Economics application needs structure and focus. Over years of helping students succeed, TASCAM Co Ltd have found that every standout application rests on five essential pillars.</p>
      <p>These elements transform your application from a list of achievements into a coherent, compelling story about why you deserve a place.</p>

      <h3>Pillar 1: Motivation and a Binding Theme</h3>
      <p>UCL’s admissions team want to see that you’re driven by more than curiosity. They want a clear reason for studying economics.</p>
      <p>A strong personal statement has a consistent thread that links your academic interests, activities, and goals together.</p>
      <p><em>For example:</em></p>
      <ul>
        <li>You became fascinated by inequality after studying game theory in maths.</li>
        <li>You explored behavioural economics while volunteering with a charity.</li>
        <li>You want to apply econometric tools to real-world development challenges.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>That sense of purpose makes your application memorable and authentic.</p>

      <h3>Pillar 2: Work Experience and Real-World Insight</h3>
      <p>You don’t need a formal internship at a hedge fund to impress UCL. What matters is how you’ve applied economic thinking in real settings.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Analysing data or solving logistical problems during a school or part-time project.</li>
        <li>Participating in a summer economics programme or an economics essay competition.</li>
        <li>Observing how policy or financial decisions affect communities.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Reflect on what you learned rather than just what you did. For instance, ‘I realised how market incentives can misalign with social outcomes’ is far more insightful than ‘I worked in a bank.’</p>

      <h3>Pillar 3: A Clear Career Plan</h3>
      <p>Many applicants stop at ‘I want to be an economist.’ Go further. Show that you’ve thought about how this degree fits into your future.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Short term:</strong> What do you want to do immediately after university?</li>
        <li><strong>Medium term:</strong> What kind of economist, analyst, or policymaker do you aim to become?</li>
        <li><strong>Long term:</strong> What real-world impact do you want your work to have?</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Pillar 4: Key Skills and Academic Strengths</h3>
      <p>Alongside motivation and career focus, highlight the skills that make you a strong fit for a quantitative, theory-driven degree:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Analytical thinking and logical reasoning.</li>
        <li>Mathematical fluency and statistical curiosity.</li>
        <li>Attention to detail and the ability to interpret data.</li>
        <li>The capacity to communicate complex ideas clearly.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Where possible, link each skill to a specific example from your studies, competitions, or extracurricular activities.</p>

      <h3>Pillar 5: Strong References and Communication</h3>
      <p>Your referees play a bigger role than most students realise. A thoughtful, specific reference can confirm your mathematical ability, enthusiasm, and work ethic, which are qualities UCL prizes.</p>
      <p><strong>To ensure this, speak to your referees early:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Share your personal statement and predicted grades.</li>
        <li>Tell them which aspects of your work you’d like highlighted (for instance, your performance in statistics or your leadership in group projects).</li>
      </ul>
      <p>A coordinated reference adds credibility to everything else in your application and reassures admissions tutors that your profile is genuine and consistent.</p>
