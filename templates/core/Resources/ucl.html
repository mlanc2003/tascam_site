        <p>I’ve lost count of how many times students have asked me: ‘How do I get into UCL?’ I can tell you what I do remember though, and that’s the answer. Here at TASCAM Co Ltd, 95% of our students get into their first or second-choice universities!</p>
        <p>UCL looks out for completely different characteristics to Oxbridge. Most applicants have great grades, so your glowing academic track record alone will not guarantee admission, nor will it help you stand out. I’ll run through some tips on how to demonstrate the X factor in this article.</p>
        <p>Some of our team at TASCAM Co Ltd are UCL alumni, and plenty have worked in admissions for leading universities. Thanks to a decade of insider knowledge, we know exactly what UCL is looking for. Work one-to-one with our UCL Admissions Tutors to maximise your chances of success.</p>

      <h2>How hard is it to get into UCL?</h2>
      <p>
        Entry to UCL is competitive. During the 2023–2024 cycle, UCL received <strong>79,082 applications</strong> and made <strong>19,676 offers</strong> — an acceptance rate of <strong>24.8%</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some programmes are significantly more selective. For example, UCL’s Fine Art (BFA) course had an acceptance rate of just <strong>6.2%</strong> in 2024. For competitive courses, working with our Undergraduate Tutors can greatly strengthen your application.

      <p class="tip">
        Insider tip: If you don’t meet the requirements, contact the department. UCL sometimes accepts equivalent qualifications or relevant experience.
      </p>

      <h2 id="english-reqs">What are UCL’s English language requirements?</h2>
      <p>
        Applicants from non-majority English-speaking countries must provide proof of English proficiency. Accepted tests include <strong>IELTS</strong> and <strong>TOEFL</strong>. Requirements vary by course — check your specific programme’s guidance.
      </p>
      <p>TASCAM Co Ltd’ English Language Tutors can help you prepare with tailored lessons that build academic confidence.</p>

      <h2 id="contextual-offers">Does UCL give contextual offers?</h2>
      <p>
        Yes. Through its <strong>Access UCL</strong> scheme, UCL supports underrepresented students. Applicants may automatically receive lower offers if they meet contextual eligibility criteria (e.g. attending low-performing schools, being first-generation, or meeting socioeconomic indicators).
      </p>

      <h2 id="insider-info">Insider information on UCL Admissions</h2>
      <h3>Choose your referee wisely</h3>
      <p>
        Your referee’s endorsement sets the tone for your UCAS application. Choose a teacher familiar with your subject who can highlight your academic strengths, attitude, and contextual factors.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Academic performance and motivation</li>
        <li>Relevant achievements and qualities</li>
        <li>Comparison with peers</li>
        <li>Extracurricular contributions</li>
        <li>Any mitigating factors</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Start postgraduate applications early</h3>
      <p>
        Postgraduate applications are reviewed on a rolling basis. Submit as early as possible with a clear statement, CV, and research proposal.
      </p>

      <h3>Do non-compulsory admissions tests</h3>
      <p>
        UCL doesn’t always require GMAT/GRE for MScs in Finance or Management, but submitting them voluntarily can boost your profile.
      </p>

      <h2 id="tips">8 tips for getting into UCL</h2>

      <h3>1. Know your subject requirements</h3>
      <p>
        Many courses require specific subjects or tests (e.g. LNAT for Law, UCAT for Medicine). Always verify requirements on the course page.
      </p>
      <p class="tip">Insider tip: Joint courses (like German & History) often have higher acceptance rates — choose wisely.</p>

      <h3>2. Have a great academic record</h3>
      <p>
        Most UCL offers range from ABB to A*A*A. Competitive subjects like Computer Science or Politics require top grades and consistency. GCSE performance (grade 5+ in English & Maths) also matters.
      </p>

      <h3>3. Highlight work experience and extracurriculars</h3>
      <p>
        Your personal statement should be 75% academic, but relevant experiences show initiative and depth. Join subject societies, attend lectures, or volunteer to show real-world engagement.
      </p>

      <h3>4. Invest in your personal statement</h3>
      <p>
        Avoid clichés and focus on insight, not intent. Link your studies to global issues or real-world debates. UCL values intellectual curiosity and analytical thinking.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        “Emphasise the academic side with reference to literature or scholarship that shaped your analysis. Save extracurriculars for the final paragraph.” — UCL Professor
      </blockquote>

      <h3>5. Mention a solid 5-year career plan</h3>
      <p>
        UCL wants applicants with purpose. Outline career goals and how UCL supports them. Reference employers, postgraduate goals, or research interests that align with your chosen field.
      </p>

      <h3>6. Go beyond your school syllabus</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Read niche books and academic papers related to your subject.</li>
        <li>Apply knowledge to real-world problems.</li>
        <li>Study UCL module content and faculty research.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="tip">UCL is “London’s Global University.” Engage with world issues and show awareness of your field’s global context.</p>

      <h3>7. Ace your admissions tests</h3>
      <p>
        UCL may require tests such as LNAT, UCAT, GMAT, GRE, ESAT, or TMUA. Preparation is key — use past papers, check benchmarks, and work with expert tutors.
      </p>

      <h3>8. Remember the purpose of your interview</h3>
      <p>
        Interviews vary by course. Medicine uses MMIs, English may include essay tasks, and postgraduate courses may use Kira Talent. Be analytical, confident, and ready to discuss your statement and readings.
      </p>

      <div class="highlight-box">
        <p><strong>Insider Tips:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Be analytical and curious in your responses.</li>
          <li>Think aloud — show reasoning, not memorisation.</li>
          <li>Review your personal statement before interviews.</li>
          <li>Test your tech if interviews are online.</li>
        </ul>
